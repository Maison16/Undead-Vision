# Undead Vision
---
Undead Vision is a project that was created for a Game jam organised by a VR student research group on a Bialystok Technical Univeristy.

We had 48 hours to finish the game and randomly picked topic was "Vision".

Our game is a 2D rouge-like horror that main mechanic is that player has a limited _vision_ and the only source of light is a lamp they're holding, so you need to be careful with your back. The game is developed entirely in a WPF environment using C#, because why not make a game within a platform not associated with game development.
