Undead Vision is a project that was created for a Game jam organised by a VR student research group on a Bialystok Technical Univeristy.

We had 48 hours to finish the game and randomly picked topic was "Vision".

Our game is a 2D rogue-like horror where the main mechanic is limited vision, with the only light source being a lamp the player holds, so beware of what's behind you! The game is developed entirely in a WPF environment using C#, because why not make a game within a platform not associated with game development.
