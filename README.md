# Undead Vision
---
Undead Vision is a project that was created for a Game jam organised by a VR student research group on a Bialystok Technical Univeristy.

We had 48 hours to finish the game and randomly picked topic was "Vision".

Our game is a 2D rouge-like horror that main mechanic is that player has a limited _vision_ and the only source of light is a lamp that he's holding, so you need to be careful with your back.

We took part in this competition to prepare for an official bigger Game jam event happening few months later.
